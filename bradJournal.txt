03-25: Wrote program to fake status codes so that server and client can be developed independently.
	   Client connects to server. Can send create account request.

03-26: Added authentication by name and pin with the server
	   Added withdraw functionality (need to add checks for amount of cash in ATM).
	   Added deposit functionality (also needs checks).
	   Added show transaction functionality.

03-27: Added buy stamps.
	   Added logout function.

	   Added a data file to track amount of cash and stamps in ATM.
